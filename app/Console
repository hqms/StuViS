The /stuvis/stuvis/app/Console directory is intended to contain console commands for the application. Since you requested the contents for this directory and it typically contains command files, I will create a placeholder file for a sample console command.

Here are the contents for the file:

/stuvis/stuvis/app/Console/Kernel.php

<?php

namespace App\Console;

use Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Console\Kernel as ConsoleKernel;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        // Define your scheduled commands here
    }

    protected function commands()
    {
        $this->load(__DIR__.'/Commands');

        // Register your commands here
    }
}
